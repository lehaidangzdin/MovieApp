    <string name="comment">"I'd just like to thank Patty Jenkins for making a DCIThoughtSheWasWithUniverse movie that wasn't fucking garbage.\n\nIf I'm being completely honest, the two people I went to the cinema to watch _Wonder Woman_ with and I did spend the next two hours after coming out of our screening discussing the various problems with the movie, but we also all agreed on one thing: We still loved it.\n\nMaybe it's just the rose-coloured glasses of comparison, but I had an excellent time with _Wonder Woman_, and I'm excited to go back to the cinema and watch it, at least one more time.\nIt's the first time I've said that about a DC movie since _The Dark Knight Rises_.\n\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"</string>
